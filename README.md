Level System
------------------

This project is for college.

The class's constructer takes in three arguments. X- and Y-value, which is basically anything you want it to be. These values are calculated inside the class based on the bar level, which is preLevel. 

The level system is built on -c = 1*x+(-y*x), where C is the bar level (bar level = if the user should level up, down or keep same level). 

To get the main idea take a look at pictures #1 and #2.
